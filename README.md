## Overview

I built a photo search website in reactjs. React.js is a JavaScript library for creating user interfaces, while Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework. The landing page aims to attract visitors and encourage specific actions. I designed the layout using Tailwind CSS utility classes and created reusable React components for different sections. The page is responsive, thanks to Tailwind CSS's responsive utility classes.Finally, i deployed the landing page to make it accessible online.
